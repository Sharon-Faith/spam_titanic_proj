# SPAM DETECTION AND TITANIC SURVIVAL ANALYSIS PROJECT
#### Jupyter notebooks
#### By **Sharon Faith**
## Description
The first notebook contains the analysis on a project whose main objective was to create a model that would be able to determine whether or not a passenger survived the titanic, based on a number of factors in using information from [this dataset](https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv). Exploratory analysis and modelling (K-Nearest-Neighbours) were carried out to aid in achieving the objective.

The second notebook contains the analysis on a project whose main objective was to create a model that would be able to determine whether or not an email is spam using the information in the dataset found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase). Exploratory analysis and modelling (Naive-Bayes Classifiers) were carried out to aid in achieving the objective.
